# team-profile-generator

## Purpose

For this project, I successfully created a CLI node application that allows managers to generate a webpage that displays his or hers team's basic info so that they have access to emails and github profiles.

The team-profile-generator was built as a NODE cli application that records pertinent information about a companies development team and then generates a HTML webpage with each team members name, id, email, and unique information based on the employee type: manager, engineer, and intern, respectively. The users can record any number of team members and can have a mixture of all employee types for each team.
